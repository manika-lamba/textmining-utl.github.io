  Machine learning and artificial intelligence are the futuristic approaches dominating all disciplines currently. Data analytics, data mining, and data science are some of the major sub-domains having a strong market of research and jobs at the instant in the world. With a long leap from paper to digitization, the burden on libraries and librarians has increased in order to manage, organize, and generate knowledge from such a huge amount of data sitting at their repositories/databases/websites. As the libraries deal with a higher percent of textual data daily, this book focuses primarily on textual data and presents the various text mining approaches with a new lens.

  Text mining is a very efficient, fast, and effective way to manage and digging out knowledge from existing data sitting in the archives of the libraries. This book will make every library and information professional competent to use text mining in their daily life and get the best use out of it by serving their patrons, researchers, faculty, or scientists with new services. Text mining techniques can be applied to any library, be it a school, university, or special library, but in a different capacity to meet the major objectives of their parent institution. It will help to serve the purpose of providing the right information to the right user at the right time by providing services like recommendation services, current awareness services, or selective dissemination services to its users. From understanding different types and forms of data to case studies that show the application of each text mining approach on data retrieved from various resources, this book will be a must-read for all the library professionals.
