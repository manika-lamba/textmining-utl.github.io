## Hands-on-Training

### The `github repository` contains a reproducible research compendium for the case study used in the book.

### So you can reproduce the analysis in the cloud without having to install any software or downloading the data. The computational environment runs using BinderHub. Click the `Virtual RSTUDIO SERVER` to open an interactive virtual RStudio environment or `VIRTUAL JUPYTER NOTEBOOK` to open an interactive virtual Jupyter notebook for a hands-on practice for the case studies that used R programming language. In the virtual environment, open the `clustering.R` file to perform topic modeling.

#### Things to Remember while Using the Virtual Environment (Binder):
#### 1. The server has limited memory so you cannot load large datasets or run big computations.
#### 2. Binder is meant for interactive and ephemeral interactive coding so an instance will die after 10 minutes of inactivity.
#### 3. An instance cannot be kept alive for more than 12 hours.

### Alternatively, you can click on `DATA` to download all the files related to the case study as a zip archive. After unpacking the downloaded zip archive, you can explore the files on your computer.

## Contents

### The compendium contains the data, code, and notebook associated with the case study. This case study is further divided into `Case Study 1A: Clustering of Documents using Orange `, and `Case Study 1B: Clustering of Documents using R`. 1A case study used Orange tool, and 1B case study used R programming language to perform clustering. It is organized as follows:

#### * `dataset.csv` file contains the data. The same dataset was used for both the case studies;
#### * `clustering.R` file contains the R code for 1B case study; and
#### * `Case_Study_1B.ipynb` file contains Jupyter notebook for 1B case study.
